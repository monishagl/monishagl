Hi, I’m @monishagl
I’m interested in building secure, scalable backend systems.
I’m currently learning about credit risk modeling, fraud detection algorithms, and distributed system design through a personal project.
I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to cybersecurity, finance, or cloud-native applications—especially in Java.
You can reach me at LinkedIn or monishagsurya@gmail.com.
Pronouns: she/her
Fun fact: I enjoy solving CTF challenges and optimizing systems in my spare time!
